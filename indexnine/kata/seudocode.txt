 
1)rows=paragraph.split(\n)
2)convert the singles line to array:-
3)loop from 0 to count_of_rows:
	3.1)split using ($) each element of rows into array
	
4)we are getting 2D array, after that we find max length out of all rows
5)for iterating through each line without out of index, we are making an indicator for each line:Lengthofrows[]
6)max(lengthOfRows[]) storing max length
7)loop(0,maxlength)
8)finding the max column length out of all the array 
9)padding each word with space and ' | ' upto maxlenth of word in column without going out of index

10 ) concatenate all the rows into single paragraph
